# AppleDataKW
This repository includes select Apple Health data for Code Ketucky Python project. 

While learning Python through the Code Kentucky program, I was tasked with creating a project to demonstrate my data analysis skills. I chose to export and analyze select data from my Apple Health app in hopes to discover trends. 

Version 1.0 - Date 6/14/2022

Hi 👋, I'm Kim Wolf - A life-long learner currently tackling Python through the Code Kentucky program.

🔭 I’m currently working on a project to analyze my health data, including Apple Watch stand hours, exercise time, heart rate, stand time, step count and walking heart rate average for the last three (3) years (time period June 1, 2019 through June 1, 2022).

🌱 I am currently learning Python.

💬 Ask me about my health goals - they are every changing, but always striving to move the needle.
